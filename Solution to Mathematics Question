QUESTION: Over all real numbers, find the minimum value of a positive real number y, such that y = √((x + 6)2 + 25) + √((x – 6)2 + 121)

SOLUTION:
 
First of all, what is a real number?
Mathematically, a real number is a value of a continuous quantity that can represent a distance along a line.

Things to note about a set of real numbers:
1)	Their multiplication are always defined.
2)	Their inverse exist
From the question, x was not defined to be a real number so, nothing can be done with the right hand side of the equation.
Also, there is no minimum value of a real number.
Therefore, the solution to the question would be the proof that there is no minimum value of y.

PROOF

y is a positive real number, therefore inverse of y exists. i.e. ½ × y exists.
Multiples of y are defined. i.e. y × 1 = y
If 0 < ½  < 1
Therefore, 0 < ½ × y < 1 × y
Since 0 is less than ½ × y no matter what positive real number value y is; therefore there is no minimum value of y.

Note: < means less than; √ means sqrt which also means square root.
